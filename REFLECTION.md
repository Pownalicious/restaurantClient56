I couldn't figure out how to do separate migration to add
columns isAdmin and accountBlocked to the users table over an existing one.  
I tried it from 3 possible ways.  
But in at end I went for the way to make a new migration for admin and block.  
Perhaps I misunderstood the question and looked at it from the wrong perspective. But I'm very curious how this is done.  
I was a bit challenged at first with using the date field.  
But figuring out how this works was a good challenge. I got the date field on the screen based on some functionalities.  
I made progres in using the tokens for authentication, after setting the authorization header in the request  
and using the auth middleware on the server side to authorize the request you get a hold it.  
I've committed code as many times as I could, I still need to work on the messages naming when committing.
Still need some progress on reading.

I still need progress with reading comprehension of an assignment, but I will work hard to improve on this.
